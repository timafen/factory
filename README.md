# Factory

Factory is infrastructure for building a software factory. It runs repeatable
software-engineering agent jobs across Git repositories and compute. Its Go
control plane stores work, shows the worker fleet, and delegates tasks. Each Go
worker currently owns one agent runtime, Codex or Claude Code.

The browser UI provides:

- an overview of execution throughput, reliability, cycle time, queue depth, and
  worker health;
- a work queue and task details;
- registered worker and repository status;
- task delegation using a title, prompt, repository, and worker.

Factory is local-first today. The server only accepts loopback connections and
does not include user authentication.

Read the [product vision](docs/software-factory/vision.md), the
[target architecture](docs/software-factory/design.md), and the
[current implementation architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md). The target design is a
direction, not a claim about current behavior.

## Quick start

Requirements:

- Go 1.25.13 or newer on the 1.25 release line, or Go 1.26.5 or newer
- Git
- `curl`
- `just`
- Codex CLI or Claude Code CLI, authenticated on the worker host

Node.js is only needed when changing the UI. Normal builds use the committed,
embedded UI assets.

GitHub Automations and on-demand worker checkout depend on the GitHub CLI,
`gh`. Factory does not include a separate GitHub API client. Install and
authenticate [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) on the control-plane host and each
eligible worker host before enabling a GitHub Automation:

```sh
gh --version
gh auth status
```

```sh
just build
mkdir -p ~/.factory
cp examples/worker.toml ~/.factory/worker.toml
```

Edit `~/.factory/worker.toml` to select `codex` or `claude-code`. Workers need
no repository list. They probe local `gh` access and acquire centrally managed
GitHub repositories on demand. Then start the server and worker:

```sh
just run
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:7337](http://127.0.0.1:7337).

Existing `factory-poller` users must stop it and use **Automations → Migrate
legacy poller** before removing their old configuration. Preview, Import, and
Finalize each verify and lock the same legacy snapshot. Import creates disabled
typed Automations and Finalize archives copies without deleting the originals.

One worker has one stable identity and a configurable pool of independent
sessions for one runtime. The pool defaults to ten slots. Run another worker
with a different config and data directory when you want both Codex and Claude
Code:

```sh
FACTORY_WORKER_CONFIG=~/.factory/claude-worker.toml \
  ~/.factory/bin/factory-worker
```

See the [local guide](docs/local.md) for a complete setup and the
[worker guide](docs/worker.md) for runtime and worktree behavior. Tagged binary
installation, upgrades, compatibility, rollback, and release verification are
covered by the [release guide](docs/release.md).

## Architecture

```text
Browser
   |
   | HTTP + JSON
   v
Go control plane
  SQLite, scheduler, typed Automation evaluators, embedded UI
   ^
   | registration, claim, heartbeat, events, completion
   |
Go workers
  one identity + one runtime + N agent slots + on-demand repository cache
   |
   +-- Codex CLI
   `-- Claude Code CLI
```

The control plane owns durable coordination. Workers own execution and Git
worktrees. Workers poll the API, so the system does not require WebSockets or
inbound connections to worker hosts.

All default state is below `~/.factory`:

```text
~/.factory/
  bin/
  server/factory.sqlite3
  config.toml       optional control-plane bootstrap only
  worker.toml
  workers/
```

Read the [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the contracts and
security boundaries.

## Current scope

Implemented:

- Go control-plane API and embedded React UI;
- durable tasks, executions, attempts, leases, events, and cancellation;
- Codex and Claude Code workers;
- reusable versioned Workflows;
- disabled-first typed GitHub issue, GitHub pull-request, and schedule
  Automations evaluated by the control plane;
- a central managed-repository catalog, bounded worker caches, and isolated Git
  worktrees;
- bounded list APIs and retained-data metrics;
- automatic cleanup of clean unchanged or published work and preservation of
  unpublished branches.

Designed but not implemented: a unified `factory` CLI.

See the [documentation index](docs/README.md) for current guides and proposed
designs.

## Development

Backend:

```sh
just test
just vet
```

UI:

```sh
just ui-install
just ui-check
```

After changing the UI, rebuild the committed assets:

```sh
just ui-build 0
```
